Vtubers are real people, so... Vtubers are real people, because behind a Vtuber there is a real person, who doesn't play a role like voice actors. In fact, that person is himself and that character we see is only the appearance, the surface. So, to make an anime character real, that character just needs to be a Vtuber and without a set history and personality. Does this reasoning make sense?
hey guys im mei inari,i will soon be a vtuber next month with my duo partner ruby🎀come join our discord server for more updates of our vtuber debut🥂there's still really less ppl in this server,so if u join,u will be an og😉link in comments👇

There is a vtuber named katalae that is in need of our help. She is doing a 24/7 stream, and if she doesn’t reach the goal, she’ll be homeless. So I hope you have the time to give some donations to her. She could really use our help. 
Free Customizable VTuber Model! South Park style you can setup at your own taste :0 ! by LuaVLucky 
A trans Vtuber who needs help. So from the title I'm transgender MtF I had the thought of wanting to be a Vtuber at some time ago and is starting to act on it finally. I have a lot planned out for the Debut and everything my only problem is my voice.  It seems no matter what I do with my voice I can't get it to a more feminine tone it'll just be a really high boy voice which isn't what I want.  I don't want to be known as a male Vtuber because of Dysphoria, I wouldn't say my Voice is low unless I force it so I have a decent middle ground of not sounding too masculine. I've tried voice training but to no avail it does not work for me.  I've been thinking of all kinds of ways to try to come up with an excuse for my voice being the way it is.  Having my avatar be more gender neutral/androgynous. Thinking of coming up with a spell that made her voice the way it is etc...  I don't want to just come out and just say "Hey I'm trans so please excuse my voice"  I dunno how the community sees us and it's a scary thought.  I have some time before the debut as this is gonna start early 2022.  Any and all advice helps. Vocal training is sadly out the window because it hasn't been in my favor for the two years I've been doing it.
Any critiques on my model? I have recently given her piercings as well

Hi, I'm new and nervous... I find indy vtubers who make/do everything themselves amazing! I've been trying to make my own model for almost a year now, and it's hard to find the time in between health and family reasons/situations that I usually end up working on it at 12am til I almost pass out at 2am almost every night and it's hard to stay motivated during those times too. Don't get me wrong though, I love doing this so much but I wish I planned more before starting.  I not very good at communicating in words so using twitter is scary to me, but I tried to force myself to use it. it's under the same name I'm using here.  Anyways, sorry for the longwinded intro/rant. and I wish good luck to everyone!  I do have questions and ideas I'd like to get other people's oppinions on them, so if i could, that'd be great.

Vtuber Research Project Hello guys, my name is Aster but I go on with different names for each of my accounts but feel free to guess what names are those if you're interested. I'm kinda new to the Vtuber community but I could say that I'm now deep down the rabbit hole. Anyways, as my title says I have a research project and its topic is all about vtubers, that's why I'm here to ask for anyone willing to participate in my interviews. My interviews are either on-call or survey forms in which you guys who are willing to participate may choose which one you are comfortable with. Additionally, anyone who has experience being a vtuber is also welcome if willing, reply down below for anyone willing to participate. That is all, thank you very much in advance to those who are willing to participate as well as those who gave time to read this post of mine and also sorry for the trouble. Also for clarification, this is a school-related research project which I will defend 3 days from now... 
Hi there! New to vtubing! Nice to meet you all! Hi there! I'm CrystalCastleGaming on Twitch. Only started vtubing a few days ago and I'm enjoying doing it so far for my incredibly few viewers lol. I'm hoping I can make some friends here and hopefully grow the channel a little bit. I'm currently planning on doing streams of FNAF: Help Wanted, Cuphead and just chatting.  Nice to meet all of you! :)
Looking to start a Vtuber Team/group if anyone is interested! Any Vtubers who are interested in joining a group/team feel free to message me! I'm looking to start a group where new and old vtubers can get together in a small group/team and be associated with one another. This will help to get fans and a fandom.  I have a google form available for anyone wanting to join.  This is open to anyone who also wants to become a Vtuber as well!  Message me for any questions or the form.  Currently we are looking for 5 members!
How to find friends? Hi guys!  I'm a new ENVtuber and I was looking for ways to get connected in the community. I was wondering if there was a Discord where people could genuinely hang out, talk about streaming, set up collabs to game together, etc? I just want to create genuine bonds in the community so any help or any friends would be great! I've followed a bunch of ("small"-ish?) Vtubers on my Twitter and tweeted for them to DM me, but no dice so far.   I'm a fairly small streamer who hasn't even made affiliate yet so I don't want to make this a post with my links since that isn't the point, but if you did want to check me out I'll post some links in the comments \^.\^

Brand New VTuber! Hey everyone! I'm brand new here and to this whole idea of streaming. If I pursue this it will be as a vtuber and therefore I am looking to commission an artist to create my avatar with me! I am looking to go with just a 2D model for now as my funds are limited, but it will be in an anime style. I will be streaming mostly Final Fantast XIV Online so, an avatar in that style would be magnificent but not at all necessary. Can I please see some samples with the requested fee? Thank you, everyone :)

i kinda wanna make this a model, anyone know any good riggers/model makers? 
Where did all these VTubers came from? I don't want to sound negative or offend anybody but the where the hell did all this VTubers just came from? It's like everyday 10 VTubers's appear out of nowhere and I want to know how is that even possible, Where do they get the money to buy the models?  Yes I know some of them are artists and they make their own models and yes I know some of them started with a cheap model or using Vroid but I'm not talking about those people, I'm talking about the people when they start streaming for the first time they already have Complete fully detail life 2D model, How did these people get that type of money these models are not cheap?

Debuting VTuber Hi everyone, I found out about Vtubing a few months ago and immediately wanted to give it a shot. I tried a lot of the default options and I quickly got to a point where I juste needed my own avatar. I had beandogge from fiverr make one for me, I think she did a great job, and  I haven't even debuted yet and I know I need the full body version now. I'm currently about to make my debut now, I didn't really think about advertising, I just wanted to have some fun.  &#x200B;  [Monte Danko](  Here's kind of a sneak peek, but I'm doing the stream now on twitch @ manmythmeme.

VTuber Lilica :3 Drawing Commission! 
should small vtubers just start streaming? hiya!!! i've found that a lot of the vtubers on twitter try and get a lot of twitter followers and then proceed onto twitch! is that because its harder to start on twitch from scratch? (i guess this makes sense..)     is it too unrealistic to think that i can grow even with a small twitter following on twitch?
I want to be a VTuber, but I don't want to roleplay. Should I stream normally? So I want to livestream, that's a fact. I'm just conflicted as to whether I should become a VTuber or livestream normally. First, I'd like to say that I would stream games as a main topic with music as a side.  I want to be a VTuber because I like the animated character more than a face cam. I want one of the two so I feel closer to my fans.   However, I don't want to be following an intricate role because I want to be myself in my streams. It seems like I'd be restricted to that role, whatever it may be.   On top of these things, I also plan to stream with a childhood friend, though he doesn't want to be a VTuber so one of us would be a VTuber and the other wouldn't be.   Any thoughts on what I should do in this situation?   Note: I have never used Reddit before, so if I didn't explain very well then I'm sorry. I literally created an account right before I made this post.

would indy vtubers like freehsic loops? Hey as the title  states. I make music and wanted to help out by giving new faces some free assets.  Is that something people would be interested  in?
Collab and promotion discord So I’ve started a discord in order for pngtubers, vtubers, and other content creators to be able to find collabs and promote their content.   All you need to do is pm me if interested me let me know what type of content creator you are, although you don’t have to make content to join. I’ve just started so there’s only me and one other person, but I hope we’ll be able to grow together^^ whether you’re an artist, gamer, or make other types of content  I’m also searching for collabs as well, whether art or gaming as I just prefer to have someone to talk to. I mainly play fps games but Minecraft and simpler games are also quite fun^^  I do create nsfw drawings though my streams and such are pg-13 but I wanted to let you know beforehand^^
Tips for a new Vtuber Twitch Streamer? I started on twitch yesterday, but im a verrryyy shy person. I don't wanna use facecam, but im fine with microphone, seeing as I already voice revealed on yt. I decided to go the route of Vtubing, but I don't know how to do most of it, and I can't afford a PC to make a lot of the stuff, and I don't wanna pay $100 for a custom avatar. Does anyone have any tips for an aspiring Vtuber who can't animate?

Getting ready to debut, what does that mean for me? Hello!   I have been thinking about streaming and making content using a model for over a year now and finally that dream is just around the corner! I currently have a model being made and is about to be rigged. My question for any Vtubers out there is, what do I need to do in order to get ready to debut?  I've been trying to look for any resources that can give me insight but haven't found too much. Currently the things I'm thinking through are: A character sheet, background(s) for streaming, and an intro video but I want to know if I'm missing some key elements before debuting.  What did you do to prepare for your debut?  Or what are you considering doing for an upcoming debut?   Any tips are super appreciated! Thanks :D

Is a debut ESSENTIAL? Hi, I've finished working on my vtuber model and setting every thing up, I am ready to go live for the first time, but naturally, I have no subscribers nor any kind of fanbase, so I feel like a debut might be a waste of time because there would not be much people there.

Do any of you guys do Highlight Reels and other such content for Youtube/Tiktok ect? Hey everyone! I've been streaming for a bit and decided to start trying other types of content on Youtube and Tiktok primarily. Anybody know any good ways to do this other than things such as highlight reels and vods? Kinda looking for inspiration/ideas to improve.  Here's an example of the highlight reel.

【Namian's VTuber Debut】April 30th 12PM EST (Today)!【EN】 
Just wondering but- I know that vtubers typically have a debut, but it isn't heresy to have an official debut stream later down the road, right? I want to start streaming but I know that the debut is typically day1 and I know that a lot of hard work goes into debuts. I was just wondering if it's okay to have an official debut event later down the road rather than at the very beginning, any thoughts?
Is it possible to be a Vtuber on ps4 or mobile without a pc.

I need help with making connections lol Hey everyone! I just started getting into Vtubing (PNGtubing specifically), and I'm having trouble connecting with people. I joined a couple discord servers and made a Twitter, and I try to engage by responding to posts. Anyone got any additional tips or am I on the right track lol
Scared about wanting to become a Vtuber    I know Hololive and Nijisanji have members and stuff that are like 18+, and i wanna be a Vtuber but by the time i have the money for my model i'll be 15. Thats when i want to start my Vtuber streams.  Can I still be a Vtuber that streams at 15 years old without having to join Hololive or Nijisanji? Because i really wanna do a debut but im pretty sure i can't without join Hololive or Nijisanji.  What do i do??

WATASHI GA KITA! Hello, everyone. My name is C+Hero. Unfortunately, Reddit doesn't allow to have a "+" in the username, but you can call me C+Hero, C+, Hero, or C-Money if you want.   I am preparing to be a Vtuber and hope to debut sometimes later in the summer or the fall. I don't have the exact debut date yet, but I would say that my model is in the progress, and it is progressing well. I will open a social media account for my moder, but I started here on Reddit to get to know fellow Vtubers in the same boat or just enjoy chatting with you all.
What they doing over there? 
Hello Reddit, yet another RUVTuber is here 
VTuber Nation has been hijacked One of my favorite youtube accounts, 'VTuber Nation' (18k subs) that posts daily vtuber clips has been turned into "History World Archives". Was this by choice or did they get hacked?  Proof the url was recently VTuber Nation:      'History World Archives': 
HiHi I'm a new Vtuber! I'm streaming gameplay on twitch, mostly RPGs. (Not linking to channel here because i haven't felt out how self promo works here yet. )  I'll probably be trolling through the subreddit as I attempt to refine production and build an audience.  So, I thought it was only polite to introduce myself.  :)  Wishing you all the best! 💕

Hello everyone! I'm Zenbuki, a bionic inkling V-tuber uploaded to the ARPANET to learn and interact with humanity! If you'd like to, come say hi on Twitch during 6pm-9pm GMT! Here's a small design preview by my scientists, I hope you like it! 
I do love Pie... 
How do I start an online presence? Hi all! I really wanna start being a vtuber (even though I still need model/name/theme) and I'm not really sure how to "begin" showing myself off online. I've never really interacted with people online before (nervous wreck) so I'm clueless on where to go, what to do, who to talk to, etc. Any advice would be super helpful. Thanks!
So there is a subreddit for us new little Vtubers~ How great is that!? So anyways, I started blasting out invitations to tomorrow's midnight release party! 
Any male vtubers with female avatars with passable voices? I'm interested as a beginner Babiniku Vtuber. I wanna know what is possible with just trained voice.
Is anonymity a must in vtubing? Hello, I've been considering becoming a vtuber for awhile now. I love the idea of coming up with a concept and character design and just having a virtual persona. But I still have a desire to express myself irl, and don't think I'd wanna be completely anonymous. I'm thinking of being a vtuber exclusively on twitch and maybe twitter but keep my Instagram as just me irl. The idea is to have both my virtual and irl personas be connected and be an extension of one another (i.e they would both be me except in different forms). Is that a bad idea? just want some thoughts cause I'm fairly new to the vtuber space
Where to start when creating a vtuber model? Hello, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this. I've got a lot of free time on my hands and thought it could be fun and interesting to learn how to make vtuber models. I'm not exactly sure where to start or what software I'd need and was wondering if anyone here could point me in the right direction.  Thanks!
Hello! Newish Goddess Vtuber and streamer! Hello! I'm still sort of new as a VTuber, and stream exclusively on Twitch at this time!My concept is more or less a deity that's found themselves an earthly avatar, and is streaming to 'preach to the masses.' I'm reworking some 'lore' bits, although that's more to dictate what kind of content I aiming to make-- I don't necessarily act in character when I'm streaming. I have some ideas to implement as soon as I get assets done to reflect the 'Church' part of my username, and I think it'll be a lot of fun once I'm able to do that!I've been toying with the idea of streaming games exclusively on Twitch, and looking to stream other content on other platforms. For instance, cozy ASMR/Soft spoken reading on Youtube or even TikTok for instance! I'd love to hear from others who've had luck with either doing that kind of content on those platforms, or if you've found yourself doing two different types of content in different places.  I'd love to collab with fellow Vtubers, and make new friends! I've had so much fun with the folks I've met already!  Also, if anyone has any constructive critiques or comments to make on my stream setup/content, I'd love to hear it! I'm always looking to improve! <3  Image for reference!

I've seen many other vtubers do them different ways, so I'm wanting to know what you beans think is good/interesting to include \^-\^    (I also posted this in another vtuber reddit space so if you're seeing this twice I'm sorry I want as many opinions as possible ;w;)

OpSec, for Noobs Aight. So. Now that I have your attention. It's y'boy. Mr. still-learning. I'm not too intimately familiar with all the apps and programs yet but I do have a sort of irrational worry. The reason I want to do VTubing is because I will have the luxury of not having to show my face. But I'm also worried that with the face tracking apps available, that someone curious enough might be able to punch through and get a pic of my face through the camera.   Ya know. The usual worries.  Does anyone here use a program that can either deter or prevent that? Or is that just something I don't need to worry about? Thanks a bunch!

Is this ok? Is Ryzen 3 Pro 4350G with 16GB ram ok for PNG tubing? Most likely I will just stream League of Legends (TFT mostly), Valorant and Art. And maybe will buy a 1050 or 1650 GPU if I got to save enough money...
Does anyone watch any horror genre vtubers? I'm somewhat new to vtubing. I don't watch very many of them yet but I've been planning mine for the better part of a year. I'm going to debut soon, but I'd love to find some other vtubers who are in the same genre. Doesn't matter what kind of vtuber they are - 3D, 2D, PNG.  ₍ᐢ.  ̫.ᐢ₎

Are there any Cornish/Gaelic Vtubers? I’m not Cornish, but I know a little of the language already 😊  The issue with learning it though is that there’s very little Cornish media out there, and it isn’t particularly mainstream :/  But I’d be really interested to hear if there are any Cornish language Vtubers, or Vtubers who speak Welsh, Irish, Scottish or Manx :)  The only other post I’ve seen referencing it is [this post]( from about a year ago, but things could have changed since then.

Hello beautiful People | VR | Vtuber Hello wonderful people,  I would like to start playing VR games soon and for that I would like to create a virtual character in a virtual environment. Since I like the idea of tying myself to real gameplay and my virtual character to virtual reality (that being said, vcharacters are very cool xD).  &#x200B;  Is it possible to create a 3D space where my character is without it taking "too much" power? Because I would need to be able to play my VR games on the side and maybe stream.  &#x200B;  What software would you guys recommend me best for creating a room and character?  I would like to track my whole body and mouth (eyes are not possible because of the headset).   Do you guys do this with a suit or webcam tracking?  What software do you use for this?  &#x200B;  I really thank you in advance for your help and for your time!  stay healthy :)

There's 3 of us, but it's not necessary for everyone to always be there. I was wondering if y'all have any ideas of what we could do. Thanks!

a little indecisive So im slowly working on my stuff for becoming a vtuber, but I'm completely stuck when it comes to a certain choice and thats what is going to be my character for it. My main issue being on what people would want to see most. I've got three to choose between and I'm mostly worried about what is a gimmick people will want to stay for.  The choices I'm stuck on are between    an albino cardigan welsh corgi person, its not just ears and a tail, tbh I would love to see more vtubers add more animal aspects to their characters thats not just ears and a tail, which is why I came up with this idea and was my original idea and design.   A magical girl parody character where a normal guy turns into a magical girl. With this one, I would have two models and honestly I feel is a cool concept   And my last one being a centaur. Personally I think a centaur vtuber would be cool and I haven't seen one as far as I know, I don't think there are any, which is one reason why I would love to do a centaur one.  Once again, my main issue is that I'm not sure on how well certain ones would do and I've come to this community for some help on that hopefully? Out of these, what would be a more interesting character you would want to watch and continue watching? I have no issue on which I would have more fun with and which idea I like more, I like all of em, but my issue is being indecisive on that issue, so some help would be majorly appreciated
First Livestream next week. Question about livestreaming (especialy game music) I am going to stream next week. The game I am planning to stream for the first time (as PNGtuber because my model is still in the process of rigging) is Marvel's Spider-Man by Insomniac Games, and I will livestream it on YouTube. I researched that there are others who still stream this game (especially the Remastered version), so I think I should be fine to stream it, but I just want to hear anyone's thought about showing the game music. I don't want to get copyright claim and not sure if this is the right place to ask, but any experience, knowledge, or comment is appreciative with how to deal this.
Introduction Hello~, my name is Ruby and my friend here is Mei, we are a new vtuber duo that is going to debut in around a month, so I thought I'd say hi first ^^.We are a demon duo that's probably going to be a little sussy.

We will try and post more info about our debut and we're hoping it would not end in loneliness ><  [here's our discord link! ](

I seem to be having some trouble posting pictures to reddit at the moment, so please check out my twitter to see the first looks at my model!  Myrki is the new Norse and Germanic Studies professor at Miskatonic University following a tragic accident involving the former professor. They're going to be feeding the more "business end" of information leading up to their debut, as well a pre-debut surprise!
I can't decide 😫 I would like to start vtubing but I'm not quite sure about the design... I know that I would like it to be an animal inspired desing. But not a cat girl or something like this because there are so many and I don't want to copy someone. So if anyone has an animal that is not seen very often I would like to know. Also I can't decide on a streamer name...  I'm open to any suggestions ♡

Highlights from the end of my first almost year of VTubing. Hope you enjoy and I get to post more this year ^_^ 
trouble with 3tene camera Hello all!    I started to make my character yesterday (using macbookpro and most current mac ios) and I have been having trouble with the 3 tene camera!! I can't zoom in on my models face only forward.   &#x200B;  I am just using my trackpad, no mouse. I'm not sure how to fix this! thank you
5 nights at freddys tonight !!  Hello everyone I just got some huge upgrades to my setup and I'd love to celebrate by playing five nights at 8 30 to 9 tonight. I'd love if you could come checke out and see all the new stuff I hooked up :)    [
3D Tracking Software with custom Rigging and motion So I am just starting out trying to make a 3D avatar, so I am not sure of the exact terminology to use. I am looking for a motion capture software that will allow for custom rigging and animation on top of the motion capture. For example, I am making a clockwork character and want to have:  1) Continuous moving parts, like gears/pistons that will spin/oscillate continuously  2)parts that move based on the character's movements. for example, gears on the hands that turn clockwise when the hand closes and counterclockwise when it opens  Is this even possible? If so are there any programs out there that are capable of this?

Starting out Vtuber help? So I'm a starting out Vtuber, Mithra Tsukiaki, I'm on twitch and I stream games constantly. I don't know how to begin as a Vtuber other than what I've read, and I've been having troubles. Can I get some constructive criticism and ideas on how to boost my numbers when it comes to hosting this content? I greatly appreciate anything you can do to help me out on this!

Hello, I'm a new Vtuber who interviews other Vtubers and I'm looking for feedback! Hello ! I must say I'm pretty excited as I just found this sub-reddit yesterday alongside some other subs.   I'm a new Vtuber who only started doing content last week and someting I'm interested in is the Vtube community as a whole, I do feel like a mistfit as I come from a different background (online speaking) which is why I wanted to start a series where I interview Vtubers.  I posted my first interview last week and the ones I know who watched it gave me only nice things to say and even though I learned a lot from producing that interview, I still want to hear what others think so that I may improve. I just uploaded my second interview and the theme is mental health and since I think this interview is somewhat different then the first one I put out, I'd love some feedback.  Here is the link:   [  I do hope this is the right sub-reddit to post this, if not, I do apologise but on the chance that it is, any feedback or advice is much appreciated :)

Anybody know or recommend any reputable 2D/3D artists? I want to get started as a vtuber, but I’m having trouble getting started. I already have my avatar designed how I wanted, but I wanted to see if there’s any trustworthy artists out there whom I can commission to make my model.   I’m aware that there are scams happening out there and people getting ripped off, so I don’t want to fall victim to that. If there’s anybody you recommend that I reach out to, that’d be fantastic.

If I buy something like this can I use it in VRoidStudio? [  Hi there, I'm trying to figure out how to get a good bunny ears set of hair for a Vtuber I'm building. If you have any great starter guides or other info that would be super helpful as well.  This says it's only confirmed to work for Avatar U 3.0 which sounds like it's some sort of VRChat program, but I'm just looking to use a Vtuber for streaming. Any help is hugely appreciated. Thank you!   Edit: I'd also probably be using it on a male model but I might need to figure out if I can make a female one look the way I want as most of the hair/clothing seems to be for female characters.

Is there a (viewer) market for non-anime VTubers? I am kind of on my own streaming journey.  I started as a GIFTuber (didn't even know that was a thing at the time) And now recently debuted my Live2d Model.  It's not anime at all, it's more like a dwarf from Snow White.    I'm trying to network with other vtubers, but I feel like I'm on the outside looking in due to just how different our approaches are.    Since I'm still kind of new to the whole thing, wondering if there's another group or term I'm just not familiar with, or maybe I'm just not following the right vtubers and this already exists and I just missed it?   tl;dr Looking to network with like-minded people.

What is the best way to make a Vtuber Avatar? I plan to make a Vtuber Avatar for funsies but of course I want it to turn out great and works well (including face morphs).   I been looking in the internet and I realized there are so many ways to make Vtubing Avatars. Does the one that involves Unity and Hana tool gives the best results?
any clip editors out there? Need advice on pricing Hi there! Apologies in advance if this type of post is not allowed, but I figured this would be the best place to ask as we can't find anything online--   My partner is a video editor and just got his first commission to do a clip edit for a vtuber. He's done some traditional video editing for pay before but it's usually for longer form stuff like weddings, graduations, etc. Does anyone have any advice on how he should charge/how much (ie flat rate vs by the hour)? We just need a general ballpark of what is the normal going rate for this type of work so that he's not over/under charging for a 30 second tiktok video. Alternatively if you've paid for an edit, we'd love to hear how much you paid and what you got out of it, again to just get a general idea on what a fair price looks like.   Thanks in advance!
Design idea issues, can't think about it at all, help! Hey all, I'm pretty stressed out over this.  I really want to start streaming as a vtuber, but I cannot conceptualize a design/concept for what I'm actually gonna be! I've never really been able to visualize myself doing anything honestly.   I DID contact an artist a bit back, and we did develop a concept, but while I do think it's cool, I don't...feel like a personal 1-1 with it. I don't really know. And I just don't know how to even think about this cause thinking about it stresses me out cause I can't think of it!  I'm really sick of this crap, and I really just wanna find a way to get through it. Any advice would help. Thank yall.

Of course I won’t accept any NSFW request or references as it might be shown on stream, but you can request a certain expression or pose but most will be headshots so I can do as many as possible. I can do humans, humanoids, and furries/ferals. I can’t do mecha or armor, sorry it’s hard 🥲  Feel free to pm me or drop your requests below^^ and check my carrd for all my social media

Still learning and seeking advice Hello, I’m still pretty new to VTubing, I’m only 2 months into streaming on twitch, I have been doing pretty good as for numbers, I am an affiliate and I average about 15 concurrent viewers. But I’d still like advice from any VTubers who have gotten to that next step. I do use stream elements to keep my viewers engaged, and I have many unique channel point redeems. I think what I need help with is moving past that 15 concurrent, I think I’m already hitting a plateau especially after climbing so quickly. Any advice, suggestions, and/or constructive criticism because I am open for any and all help.

All hands!!! … What’s up! \^\_\^   So you might have noticed no tweets of a new schedule came out for this week. That is MOSTLY because I am kinda' ALWAYS on the sleepy side and therefore lazy\~<3   It actually just hit me like a brick last week, that I have been putting my all in since the day I started 9 months ago. I am blown away by what we have achieved in that time:   Today we have:  187 Followers on Twitter  93 Followers on Twitch  41 subscribers on youtube  And   27 Crew Memebers on our discord.  That is INSANE I am SO PROUD!!!  There is no way I am giving this up I love doing this and I love playing around with you guys,   But those youtube numbers are hurting my soul, and I have hundreds of hours of videos to clip up.   That being said, I have decided that now is the time to take a break. I would like to get some rest and do some post editing content for a month and some change!   I think I would like to come back in May, and would very much hope you will come see us again when the time comes.   Please remember, I will cherish each and every moment we share, throughout the seas of time.   Until we return Try to smile, Ok \^\_\^

Looking for VTubers!! The Post below is a copy and paste of the post we’ve been using to recruit people to our SMP server but we’re especially looking to add a few vtubers at the most so your application would be favored and more than welcomed if your interested!    —————————————————————   Me and a group of 5 others i’ve met on Discord are working on creating a Minecraft SMP of around 10-14 to start (20-30 at peak/end). The concept is to have a fun SMP server and let the lore happen naturally. Targeted at Smaller Streamers to help build a community and grow together.  Only Musts:   Mic, PC Minecraft, and ability to stream at least every other day.  Preferred Players:   Webcam/V-Tubers.  Players that can stream daily.  NA/SA Players (Trying to start on a lateish American timezone stream schedule and introduce EU timezone players later) (EU Players may still apply and if you can stream on American hours it is irrelevant where you’re from).  Women (The goal is to have the server be 1/3 to 1/4 women to add diversity and to appeal to more audiences).  Will be Reviewing ALL applicants. Link a Twitch (to scout content) and a way to reach you (discord or other social media’s)   DON’T BE SCARED TO APPLY! YOUR STREAMS DON’T HAVE TO BE PERFECT IF WE SEE TALENT WE WILL TAKE A CHANCE 💚
This message is for everyone who know someone that wanted to be a vtuber that is a Filipino citizen and resides in the Philippines currently: **This is just a head's up, I'm from the Philippines, we might have a slight problem for incoming/future Filipino vtubers: We might get a new law that has a loop hole where the use of fictitious names is illegal on new accounts on any social media platform that includes youtube and twitch. If the law gets unsigned in 30 days it still passes into law, we still got 19 days left from now, if they are filipinos residing inside the Philippines and wants to become a vtuber, they should do it now, because most of the cyber laws of our country are only effective within the implementation period.**
Does lore matter? Every Vtuber I've seen so far has some backstory to their character, whether they're a dragon girl from another dimension, a cowboy that's time travelled 200 years from the past, or a manifestation of an entire star system.  So I'm curious, does anyone care about those backstories? Does adding lore to a Vtuber model enhance the viewer experience for you? Would you feel upset or disappointed if you found a Vtuber who didn't have any crazy lore?  I mainly ask because it seems like an arbitrary requirement and yet everyone does it. Is it ok to buck the trend or would you be losing a key element by fore-going having a backstory?

Vtuber newbie Hi everybody! (Dr. Nicks voice)  I’m really wanting to add a animated version of myself to my twitch streams, but I’m at a loss on how to do so. I have a way to use stream labs and the reality app to stream to twitch, but I have no idea how to overlay and play a game via my Xbox. (If that’s even possible.) Any tips? I’m broke, so anything extremely pricey is out of my reach.

Urgent help with booth payments!! I’m trying to get the Hana tool for face rigging but it won’t accept any of my payments. I tried PayPal, bank card, Rakuten, and my last option is white rabbit express but that racks the price up to almost $20 when it would be $8.68. I don’t know what to do are there any other ways I can pay on booth or get the Hana tool?

Any recommendations on who to commission 3d avatars from? I've been trying to find someone from which I can commission a model with the 52 ARKit blendshapes for VSeeFace. My first choice would have probably been TheArtGun but, as far as I am aware, their comms are closed for now. Does anyone have any suggestions for people with similar rigging quality?  &#x200B;  (also, for whatever reason reddit isn't letting me use the advice flair, only NSFW or Spoiler, so no flair for me IG)

Female Vtuber Duo Needs Producer! Hi! My name is Star, and my friend and I are making our own Idol-duo! We literally just started, so we're brand new. We have a logo that she made (She's an artist!) and I'm working on some lyrics for songs! We plan to do some covers, but would like to make our own music!      We're looking for someone to produce EDM, Pop, Cyber, and "Idol" type music! We call our aesthetic Cyber Kawaii if that helps get the gist! Since we just started, we don't have much of a budget at all, but we also don't expect you to spend all of your time working with us!      for my personal set up, I use a Blue Yeti pro mic with a pop filter. I also use audacity with "Voice over" settings (meaning I'm good removing background noise without degrading audio quality). I also recently got Izotope RX Elements and it's amazing, my audio is really clear!      I have a few song references for the kind of music we're looking for:  [  [  [     I also have a few references of my own singing, though not entirely in the style I'm looking for (all recorded before I got RX Elements):     [  This is my own original RAP     [     [     Please let me know if you'd be willing to work with us!

Trying to be a Vtuber. Hi, reddit.  I am looking on how to set up doing vtubing stuff.  I watched a tutorial before that shows how to set up a 3d model in blender and then putting it in unity, then VSeeFace... The way the video was explained kind of didn't make any sense to me. I tried to find out how they did it, but they did skip some parts and it's like they expect everyone to understand.  TL;DR: I am looking for some proper tutorials that explain how to  do stuff with some clear explanation (preferably with captions on it -- Like Autocaptions or actual captions written by the vtuber/youtuber).  Thanks

HI hi im new to vtubing hi my name is RedSkyNexus I'm a male VTuber im also new to reddit
Hey Reddit! Could you give me your two cents on this idea I had? Firstly, hello. My name is Maia. I am on a brand new account specifically made to be tied to what is suggested below... in the low case this actually takes off.  &#x200B;  A week or so back, I was impressed and engaged in a VTuber event called the "[New Year's Monster Mash]( My New Years resolution, ever since sometime in June, was to specifically help get events going like this. And while there are various lists that many wonderful VTubers post out there, such as the "[VTuber Cinematic Universe]( tier list, I feel that this can be done more, and on a bigger scale.     This year, I want to go all-in on this kind of engagement and fulfill my New Years resolution, and get many, MANY things like this going. All inclusive and unbiased, from Hololive-level popularity, all the way down to PNGTubers that just started less than a week ago. From people with professional setups, to ones that are stuck using laptops from 10 years ago. I want to introduce various collabs, events, and  monthly contests that EVERYONE can take part in, and gives everyone a chance to shine. I want to get people together, help forge new relationships, and give everyone moments they can remember this year.     That said... I know this is a big undertaking. And quite frankly, I've only been following the VTuber community for little more than a year. I don't know if something like this has been attempted, is plausible, or already exists. And I don't want any relationships or memories from this to feel forced, but organic. Which is why I'm coming here to ask for opinions: what are YOUR thoughts on something like this? Can it be done?     I am a VTuber myself - albeit not exactly big, and not linked to this Reddit account - and so far this seems like something that can be done. But I'd like some outside perspective. Any thoughts, concerns, etc. would be greatly appreciated, before I actually dedicate to this.
best method to convert an Unreal Engine Rigged Character + Face Blend Shapes into a VTuber model?  Hey. I'm totally new to the whole Vtubing world and I need guidance on how can I set up my Vtubing character.  First of all, I neither have a mocap suite nor have an iPhone. So I'm looking for a Vtube solution that works with a webcam. so first of all, what do you suggest to me?  Secondly, I have my character rigged in accordance with Unreal Engine Epic Skeleton, and It also has some blend shapes ( Morph Targets ) for facial expressions/ Talking/Blinking. Do I have to fully rig my character's face to be able to work properly in Vtuber apps, or is there any VTuber software which works with blend shapes as well?  and If rigging the face is a necessity, is blender auto rig pro enough for that? (I rigged my character for Unreal Engine using that addon and it works really well)
Feedback on my model? Howdy! local strawberry cow momma here, I've been workin' on my model since April now and it's undergone a lot of changes, I was just hoping to receive some feedback on my latest version and see how people like it? I haven't had an official debut yet, But hopefully my work will pay off eventually!  Please let me know what you think!

is there train vtuber yet? An odd yet amusing idea to me, don't know why.  Male or female, preferably English-speaking.  Personally I'd prefer them to pay homage to Thomas the Tank Engine and Ivor the Engine, so I'd prefer a steam train based Avatar.
Decided to try this VTuber thing I love watching them, and so do you, so I figured why not join the party?

Hey there! I'm a new Vtuber. And I need help! Good day!  I'm starting out in my journey as a Vtuber on Twitch, and I know super little about how any of the model creation process works. In fact, I have a fan/friend from my chat that's been building my model and doing EXCELLENT work on it. Super proud of him. The problem, though, is that his .vrms work on nearly nothing. The only application I've been able to get working with his .vrms that won't absolutely explode is VTuber Editor/Maker. And yes, I've tried a lot of software, and that's not the sort of suggestions I'm looking for here.  What I am looking for is advice/help regarding the situation. I'd like to know if there's some guides, since he's making a lot of this from scratch using Unity, and perhaps an expert that would be interested in examining some of his work and providing input. My big concern is that said fan/friend has put in so much work into this and is getting unfortunately frustrated with some of the struggles despite being a rather accomplished 3D designer. I don't want him to burn out. And I would like him to be able to finish this project that he worked so hard on.  So, is anyone able/willing to provide some good information regarding compatibility with Vtuber software? Or perhaps wanting to look at the work he's done and write up a quick bit of input on what could causing so many crash problems?  Admittedly, being such a noob at this, I don't even know what I'm really asking here, but I don't want him to keep spinning his wheels and making such little progress.  Please help! And thank you for taking the time to read if you've come this far.

Is an avatar PNG lighting up when I talk good enough while i dont have the budget/skill to have a good looking 2d model? I used to use a Vroid model I made bit it looked bad unless I used peoples stuff, which I didn't want to do because of licensing and what not. I also dont have much art skill, even less so digitally. I did however make an OC in PSO2:NG which is basically an Anime MMORPG. I use a bust of that as my avatar? Is this a good thing or would this deter people from my content?

Vtuber Model Reveal! 
Advice on 3D modeling Hi there! I've always liked Vtubing from a distance, but I could never involve myself since my PC couldn't really watch or do livestreams but I finally can!  I'm now looking to make a model, but 3D since i can do that better than 2D art, and commissions are out of my budget. I'm looking for any simple info on what program i could use to make a model, how difficult it would be to add the stuff I've heard like bones (i'd only be doing face tracking so no need for lower body stuff)   I've tried Vroid and it's a great maker, but I'm looking for something less with set pieces and where i have more freedom.   Thanks in advance for any answers and any help!!

Questions regarding model reveals and what to do if it doesn't get any traction First off, thanks for your attention >.<  I'm a pre-debut vtuber. I posted my model reveal about a month ago but I couldn't really get much traction on it and admitedly I'm bad at being a frequent tweeter as I don't know what to tweet about or I tend to forget.  Are there any tips to how I could potentially give attention to the reveal or me in general, and potentially any tips on what I should do if the reveal fails? I'm tempted to just set a date and stream without much else but I also feel like since I've already posted the reveal I should finish through.  Any tips appreciated and thanks in advance! <3

Do you think a male vtuber can be as interesting as a female vtuber? For many reasons, female vtubers are more succesful than male vtubers, cute voice, character design and things like that, but I wan't to know,  do you think a male vtuber can get as much attention as a female vtuber?  [View Poll](
I want to be a vtuber, any advice how to be one? I've watched many YouTube videos about this already but wanted to know more. Like which is a better platform to start, how to promote, which should I invest more starting up. Etc.

Hi Everyone! ENVtuber, VERYYYYYY, new to the scene. So first I wanna start off by saying I'm already in love with the community I'm seeing as I slowly start to unlock the doors that are the VTubing Community. Secondly I love the lore and back story so many people have created for their Vtuber!  \- Now for the business part: I have a question I hope that someone can either A) Answer or B) point me in the right direction to do research for. My question is - My Rigging/Artist Designer told me that using a Iphone will work better with my caputring in Vtube Studio versus with a conventional Webcam. I have the money to buy one but of course my dumbself is all needing to know if the phone has to have service? If a Iphone XR will work well for this IR Depth tracking thing and what else I potentially will need to do with said Iphone XR to set it up. Any help would be great!!!  &#x200B;  Side note: Feel I should give you some background/history about my Vtuber Model.  Her name is Becky Savage, she's a RP Character that started on a GTA V RP Server called RP First back in late 2017 and has taken over much of what I do now in any video games. She's your typical Valley Girl Humanoid from a GTA Setting of Los Santos. Born and Raised there and over the course of her 31 years of life overcame many obstuciles to be on the straight and narrow path of becoming one of LSPD's finest as a Police officer. In her off time she enjoys fixing up cars, painting cars, going off roading and just having a good laugh with all her friends.  She is a moderatly lewd individual and wears a set of Devil horns to always tell people, "See how Horny I am?"  Again, thank you in advance for any help with the Iphone XR cam questions and I look forward to being around in this community!

Trying to be a vtuber Hello guys, my name is Neor and I want to be a vtuber, the problem is that I already made the model and for a while the Vmagicmirror app was working, suddenly it started to remove me and it doesn't let me do anything, I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and It is still the same. I already gave up hope to use this app, so can someone tell me what other app works without a webcam to control my model?
Just started VTubing a month ago. Looking for any advice that could help my journey! :D I'm an a trans Vtuber who streams competitive Apex in hopes for one day to be involved in eSports one day, I put in the work into Aim Training and such. I know most Vtubers are usually casual gamers, variety streamers or just chatting, wonder if I made the wrong choice, but I really enjoy it. Affiliate is probably the toughest challenge, most peeps would know the infamous 3 viewers requirement struggle haha. I have started a TikTok, I market on Insta and try to inform as much when I stream but most of my viewership comes from when I kill people in game. Any advice and tips would help greatly. Thank you!!!
Feet wet, or head first? Hello all! I'm trying to see what my options are to become a Vtuber. I've been a particular fan of GirlDM's model, with how fluid her model moves and the little details that was put into it. I was wondering if I can get the same amount of detailed tracking with an Android device? I'm also looking to get a similar quality of artstyle/rigging. Well, that's the start of my list of questions for now! Thanks for reading and can't wait to join the club!

Which is the best to use for vtubers: OBS/Streamlabs/Streamelements? Hi all! I'm planning to start off with my vtuber journey on twitch and I'm wondering for vtubers, which streaming software is best to use between OBS, Streamlabs, and Streamelements?  For regular streaming, I've heard streamlabs is the easiest to use, but is there any preference for what vtubers should use? I wish I knew which softwares huge vtubers used in their setup, so I could just emulate it. so please let me know your thoughts! :)

hello? 
How much would you spend on a model? Someone wants me to design 2 full body models (just artwork, no rigging). I've never done a VTuber commission before, only normal illustrations. I've been researching on how to format PSDs and the whole process of making separate layers for the body parts seems fairly complex and time-consuming (for me). How much do people usually charge for drawing the model + formatting the file? Judging by the amount of effort I'd have to put in to organize all the layers as well as the insane level of detail the characters have, I'm thinking of possibly $350-400 each. Would that be too much or is it fair?

why don't most vtubers have clothing as part of their merch? To be fair, I've only looked at the merch options for a few vtubers, but none of them have clothing options. It's all Keychains, stickers and boob/butt mousepads. None of which I personally really have any use for.   Something like a t-shirt seems like such an obvious choice for a merch store, but I haven't seen any. The closest I've found is an unofficial dollar store quality korone shirt on amazon.    I'm not trying to tell them what to put on their merch stores or anything, I'm just wondering why what seems like an obvious choice is rarely an option.

Trying to work on starting commissions to support my vtubing? I haven't started Vtubing officially as my current computer sucks and I really want a better one. However, it's taking a longer time then I imagined it would to save up for it due to personal reasons. I'm considering starting commissions, but where do you think would be the best place to post commissions? Should I do it on Ko-fi, Etsy, or something else? Any ideas or tips would be appreciated.
When being a vtuber just isn't for you Hi all. I've lurked for a while but this is my first time posting because I'd like to get some input. Currently I'm a faceless streamer considering transitioning into a vtuber. My channel already has a pretty defined aesthetic/theme that I can build a character around. But I have some concerns that I won't be able to meet the expectations viewers have of vtubers.  I worry that making a big backstory of a computer AI/cat girl succubus/time traveling musician/ect ect limits what I can do or say. There's a fine line between crafting a persona or being pigeonholed into a gimmick. I want to be able to talk about what's going on in my life without ruining the immersion for the viewer. I want it to be me, not an OC.  I also enjoy talking about other streamers I like, not specifically vtubers, and even do streamer merch giveaways for milestones. But this doesn't seem to be the way vtubers operate, I feel like they exist in a separate realm that doesn't often reference "real world," only other vtubers like within Hololive.  Also occasionally I like doing unboxing streams, but I feel like I would have to give those up entirely since showing a real person (even just hands) completely defeats the purpose of vtubers and viewers wouldn't like it.  So what are your thoughts? Do you think my concerns are valid and being a vtuber just isn't for me? Or maybe just using an avatar without the traditional vtuber lore? Maybe my perception of vtuber culture is off. I'd really appreciate some honest feedback!

New to Vtubing/ some questions Not sure if this is the right place to ask^^ I wanted to get into vtubing after seeing some pretty cool models and got inspired to draw my own, currently still on the cutting and finishing the drawings phase and not yet rigging. To be honest, I’m definitely more interested in the artistic part of this and less the content creation. However, I wanted to start creating some internet content anyway and thought this could be a great chance. Having not been interested in the vtuber fandom prior to this and only vaguely knowing it was there, I’m not too well versed in the world of vtubing, and how exactly to go with it. Are there any tips out there? Especially on things like managing a social media for the avatar and thing like getting in character for lore etc. Or maybe good vtuber recommendations for me to get a good idea on what’s out there and what type of content is usually made. I’ve also noticed there were a lot less male vtubers so I’m not sure if that’s a bad thing or-  Thanks, frc

Networking and Audience Engagement while playing a character - new vtuber struggling with off-stream interaction Greetings,  I have problems because I don't know how to "interact" with other communities and start growing without sounding like a dick or like I'm shamelessly trying to find viewers for my streams.  I created a character which I knew would be a little... "cocky", sometimes, because he wants others to see him as the godly something that I wrote in the lore.  He \*should\* sound entitled, and that is part of the character.  And I thought that being anonymous would help me self-promo and interact with the community without my shyness - and this "not wanting to be a bother" issue that I always had - blocking me, but it didn't apparently.  Also, interacting that way when writing could lead to a misrepresentation of my character because I'm empathetic enough during my streams and livestream interactions and you can tell I'm joking when saying that I'm the best in the world or that I invented fire, but while writing to a bunch of strangers how can I not sound like a complete douche?  And then there's also the networking part: do vtubers talk to each other in character when in private? Should I ask small streamer like me to collaborate "in-character"? Or do we all just recognize we are just content creators and talk like normal people behind the scenes?  I never wrote here before but I read many posts over time that helped me in the past months.I'm a new vtuber writing in incognito because I don't want to break out of character.I didn't even present my character here when I started because I was already struggling with these issues.  TL;DR: I don't know how, when and where I should write in socials or to collaborate with others.  Thanks for reading.

As a twitch affiliate, when I buy assets from booth.pm and other sites, should I pay the normal fee or the commercial fee? I am a small streamer and just wondering if streaming on twitch counts as "commercial" user as I am eligible for subs and bits. I'm new to this community and I don't want to underpay the artists who put so much work into this stuff!  Also, if I pay for the commercial fee, would that cover being used as a base for emotes? I'm not sure if I will do that yet, just wondering if that changes things.  Thanks for the advice!

I'm looking to Twitch Stream some mobile games but really want to set up a Vtuber personality - I've downloaded Vtube Studio and am looking towards getting a Live2D model made/rigged.       Is it possible to overlay the Live2D persona onto my mobile gameplay - or would that be too much for the device to handle?  Not to mention the issues with the front facing camera...     Also, is it still possible to stream Switch games via an Xbox One console?  As I'd also like to play Switch games - I guess that would free up the iPhone w/Vtube Studio for that - I'd only need to figure out how to overlay onto the Stream?

A weird dream I had Aight, weirdest dream, that I remember xd. I was in my neighborhood, it was like I woke up there, like kidnapped. I woke up in the ground, and next to me, there was a Vtuber that I follow. She started following a fat guy, we got on his car, and arrived at a big mansion. The fat guy lived there, he entered but not us. It turns out it was something surprising for the Vtuber, because she was really confident he'd let her enter. Since we were in my neighborhood, and she was very hurt from the kidnap, I offered to take her to my place, although I didn't know were she could stay lmao. I'm still living with my parents (even in the dream) and we don't have a spare room. I was probably going to offer her my bed and me to stay in the sofa or smth. She felt so betrayed, and I remember thinking damn, I can save this girl. It was as of she had no real friends and I was the only one that could support her (so far from reality lmao). And just as we were about to get home, I woke up lol.  The name of the Vtuber was OniGiriEN, she's really cool, you can find her on Twitch. Her community is nothing like what I've described in my dream btw. A very Seiso Vtuber if u ask me KEKW.

I'm a Furry Vtuber using a temporary 3D model with plants to commission a custom 3D version soon. I play a wide range of games but am recently focusing on Horizon Zero Dawn.   &#x200B;  I try to stream every day that I can, but life sometimes gets in the way.   &#x200B;  At the moment, I am seeking advice on growth and critique of the things I do to know how to do it better.   Thank you.  &#x200B;  [Twitch.tv/MarkMoonfang](  [

I NEED YOUR HELP First of all sorry for being so sudden with this promotion. I need your help. Today, these three girls announced that two of them are going to graduate due not reaching their goal of 20K subs on their channel. They share the same channel, they are fun and entertaining, they worked hard to make this work but it's all going to waste.  &#x200B;  So please, I just want you to check them and if you find them worth, please subscribe. Just 20.000 subs. (IDK if it's already too late but it is my last resort to give them back the joy they gave to me)  &#x200B;  Thanks. Here's the link to their channel: [JoshiGakuinV](

A potential PC I am entering the Vtubeing world soon, I am looking for a potential PC as I'm selling my current laptop just to do it! The PC I'm looking at has a GTX 1060 6gb I7 7700 16gb of ram  I'm thinking it'll be fine but I want as many opinions as possible. Once I get a PC that's worth using for Vtubing then I'll start in my model and rigging.
Does anyone know a person who does png rigging for vtubing?

Advice on vtuber model Im looking to create a vtuber model based off the pokemon sylveon but im worried about getting copyright striked from nintendo. Im making changes to the model to avoid that. These include colour, aesthetic and making it humanoid, Im borrowing very little but these also define the model. Should i give up and make a new model to avoid copyright or will this be substantial change to keep me safe

Feedback and Suggestions Hello I am Razorwind! I'm an English Male VTuber on Twitch. Lately I have been getting a steady growth of followers but a decline in viewers lately. This may be due to people going back to school as many of my viewers are high school and college students, however I feel like it may be more than just that.     I am open to hear any feedback and constructive criticism on what I may be doing wrong or how I can do better? I'm new to Reddit and have never really used it before so this is my first time making a  Reddit post. Here is the VOD of my most recent stream of the new content update for Ghost Recon: Breakpoint as the game has undergone a tremendous amount of improvement since its God awful launch.     [
Hi everyone! I'm a new VTuber, and I just uploaded my first video to YouTube! I'd love some critique and to make some new friends. 
New VTuber Mister_Carrots! - Coming Soon to a Twitch Near You :D    sup? I'm Mister Carrots, a pre-debut VTuber just starting out on Twitch! I enjoy hopping around, frolicking in the meadows, and eating trash on the ground.  My model is currently being worked on and rigged, so my debut will be sooner than you think :)  During my streams I enjoy playing games and chatting with whoever happens to stop by. This month I'm looking forward to streaming lots of scary horror games because it's October and stuff. So far I've played a couple of indie games like Happy Game by Amanita Design, Blood West by HYPERSTRANGE, Hypnagogia by SodaRaptor and Dread Delusion last night by James Wragg.  Come stop by if you want to check out more scary stuff before the month is over.  [  [

Looking for information on how to edit Vroid 1.4.2 Animal Ear Accessory to move with Expressions for Vseeface Sorry, I have been trying to google this but I've been getting a lot of old results as well as a ton of stuff that is related but not exactly my issue.  Or 3 hour long tutorials on how to do EVERYTHING for EVERY PROGRAM, when I just want this one thing for this one specific program.  So I was just wondering if possible, if anyone here already happens to have some good resources specifically for how to edit the default animal ears accessory in Vroid 1.4.2 to move with expressions for Vseeface.  I have both Blender and Unity.  At best I have found a video on how to make animations for the ears that I have to press buttons for to make them move, but that's not what I want.  I want to change it so that whenever my model makes the "angry" expression the ears move with it automatically, no button pressing involved.   Perhaps an idle animation too, but that's not as important as the expressions.  Bonus if I can also animate the tail with the expressions as well!  But it's not seen very often so it's also not as important.  Sorry if this is the wrong place to be posting this or asking this, if so I would appreciate being pointed in the right direction!  And if you'd like to see my model, I have a video of her here:  [
I'm looking for a someone who wants to use my live2d models for vtubing Hello! I'm amateur artist, and my main spec is Visual Novel creating. And I'm making live2d sprites and arts for the heroines of these games. I don't actually need them for anything else (since I'm a male + I dont have any plans to stream). So I can give you them for free. In exchange, you should just credit me properly (don't resell this model, don't say that you're creator + put the link to the game under your description). If you have voice which fits the character or you rly want start vtubing, it would be great.   This is an example of the model + one of the art (it's animated too):  [Sprite](  &#x200B;  [Example of the expression \(stars are sparkling, but you see it only in the video\)](  [CG](  They all are animated relatively okay (though it's far away from the good standards). They have body XYZ, eye blinking, lips + some emotions. If you're interested, DM me or write via discord AI#4242.

Best practices for Collab Hi guys! I'm a new-ish Vtuber and I've been doing semi-regular collabs and also organizing things line charity streams. This might be more of a how do you human thing but how do you all handle things when people can't make it or don't show up? I sorta downplay it and just say like that's fine I'll figure it out etc etc but like... Sometimes it's not fine and can be really stressful to find a fill. I never want to make anyone feel bad but what are your best tips for establishing and upholding boundaries with fellow collaborators?

just finished working on promos for a special stream, but I'm not sure where to post them. I have a set of images designed to reveal my model and some lore/personality details over the days leading up to the event, and I was thinking about setting follower goals to have the next image be posted early. however, I do not currently have definite plans to do any vtubing outside of special streams such as this one (this stream is in part an opportunity for me to try it out), and all of my social media is geared towards my existing non-vtuber streams.  would it be better to post the promos to dedicated social media accounts for this, or post them to my existing ones even though not all of my content will be what any new followers gained from the promos are necessarily looking for?

Seeking advice on animating unique(?) 3D vtuber Hello all.  I've been looking and searching, and maybe I'm not looking for the right thing due to my lack of understanding/wording, but I can't seem to find the answer I am searching for.  I'm looking to animate a 3D model of General Grievous from Star Wars.  I have the entire model in blender:  [     What I am looking to do is have him waist up on screen, and whenever I talk, have his head, arms, fingers, and body in motion as if it is him talking. I don't need it to emulate me, I just need it with generic movements.  I hope I am explaining this correctly.  If this is something I can do myself, I'm willing to try.  I am very tech savvy, I just have zero experience with 3D modeling/animation.  In all honesty, I would prefer to commission someone to do it, so it is done right, but I'm not sure where to look for someone that could do this.
